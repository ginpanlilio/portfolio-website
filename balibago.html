                    <p>
                        For this project, I designed a native mobile payment app to service the customers of Balibago
                        Waterworks Systems, Inc. (BWSI),
                        an operational water utilities company in the Philippines. Based on competitor research and
                        discussions with the company's President,
                        there is a need for the app as they currently do not have one which puts them behind and at a
                        disadvantage compared to their competitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With thorough research on features of existing competitor apps and by understanding BWSI's
                        customers' most pressing needs and expectations
                        and how this product would offer convenience, I was able to define the key objectives of what
                        the Balibago app will offer.

                            Balibago Waterworks Systems, Inc. is a water utility company that services 76 branches
                            across 21
                            provinces in the Philippines.
                            At the moment, the system is unorganized and outdated. Other utility companies have
                            mobile
                            apps
                            where transactions,
                            specifically payments, can be done. BWSI does not have an app, only a website.
                            Due to the large customer base of the company, an app will be useful and advantageous to
                            the
                            direct customers of BWSI. It will be an added value to them because of
                            it's accessibility and convenience, solving a user's:

                <ol>
                    <li>The existing website is where customers can read about the company's updates. It is more
                        informational vs functional and intuitive for users to transact with
                        or complete tasks.</li>
                    <li>These are payment options which can be done through 3rd party apps (Bayad, PayMaya, Gcash) which
                        offers some convenience if the user already has to app
                        downloaded on their phones. However, users will have to input the details on their own. Payments
                        can
                        not be made through their website.</li>
                    <li>Contact form for users to get in touch with customer service. Although a confirmation is
                        emailed,
                        response time is dependent on the person who receives the emails.</li>

                    <h4>USER RESEARCH</h4>
                    <h2>User Objectives</h2>
                    <h3>Who is the app for?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The app is for customers of the company who would like to view their bills, get updates and pay
                        and
                        get
                        in touch with customer service.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What kind of tasks will users complete as they use the app? JOBS TO BE DONE (JTBD)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The tasks for the users include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>viewing their billing statements</li>
                        <li>paying their bills</li>
                        <li>contacting customer service</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>When will the users use the app?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The users will use the app monthly, weekly and whenever they feel the need to or want to check
                        their
                        bills or contact customer service for any concerns.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Where will they use the app?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The users will use the app on their mobile devices therefore giving them the flexibility to
                        check
                        the
                        app anytime and from any location (including worldwide).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why is the product more suited to a native mobile app than a responsive web app?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It would be easier for users to log in and use the app's features without needing to access the
                        web.
                        Since many people have their phones with them most of the day,
                        having a native mobile app is convenient and more accessible, especially when users are on the
                        go.

                <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    I compared and reviewed different utility apps and other payment service apps to give me an idea of
                    how
                    each one presented information, the flow and information
                    architecture. I wanted to also gather details on what services they offered and how each app was
                    able to
                    translate it through the visual presentation and implementation of elements.
                    Below you'll find some information about each of the competitors:
                </p>
                <h3>GCash</h3>
                <p>
                    The top Philippine payment mobile app at present. It has made transferring cash and making payments
                    through mobile a lot more practical for Filipinos who
                    are heavily dependent on their mobile phones. They also offer a range of other services including
                    but
                    not limited to insurance policies and investments.
                </p>
                <h3>Meralco</h3>
                <p>
                    An electric company that distributes power to Metro Manila and other provinces. It has recently made
                    payments more convenient through their responsive web and app services.
                </p>
                <h3>Manila Water</h3>
                <p>
                    Water distribution company and direct competitor of Balibago Waterworks.

                <p>
                    "Philippines is tied with Indonesia for the highest number of Android smartphone users that use
                    their
                    gadgets for mobile payments, according to a global research on digital
                    payments conducted by multi-national cybersecurity firm Kaspersky." Based on the recent findings /
                    studies, it therefore makes sense that Balibago should have a mobile app for
                    practical and convenient reasons to better serve their customers.

                        After organizing the architecture information of the product and narrowing down to three user
                        flows
                        for the MVP, I came up with mid-fidelity wireframes that went through Usability Testing to get
                        feedback for improvements.
                        The product went through several iterations and minor adjustment such as aligning some of the
                        elements to to the grid. Some buttons were not functioning properly and padding had to be added
                        around to make it easy to press.
                        The logo also go a fresh makeover. Overall, the usability test was a success and the product was
                        ready after that to go through the UI design phase for the visual elements to be applied.
                        Below is the transition from mid-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity wireframes.

                            It was clear from the get-go that there was a need to design a native mobile app for
                            Balibago
                            Waterworks. After doing research on competitors and the services they offer, Balibago had
                            some
                            catching up to do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How was the problem approached? From user research and information shared by the company, I
                            took
                            note that users were frustrated for different reasons. From the payment delays due to not
                            receiving
                            bills for
                            those who are still receiving paper billings, to not being able to view their statements on
                            hand
                            for
                            payment (example, a user finds himself in an area with wifi and wants to pay but does not
                            remember
                            the amount due) to issues
                            related to reaching customer service to file reports and the uncertainty of not getting a
                            response
                            right away. These are some complaints in a list of many.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With these in mind, I was able to review other payment apps and I took from them the
                            features
                            that I
                            felt would make the navigation and usability of the app easy. Through research it answered
                            questions
                            such as:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                How did customers view billing statements? Was it through a downloaded pdf file or was
                                it
                                shown
                                immediate on the homepage? I found that showing the amount on the home screen was a
                                practical
                                straightforward feature with a
                                CTA for payment. No need to keep going back to the statement to check the amount which
                                is an
                                added step.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                When paying, will the user have to input the amount due or will they be able to view,
                                click
                                and
                                pay? What are the available payment options that would be easy for all customers based
                                on
                                demographics?
                                Most apps now include credit card and access to third party payments accessible with the
                                native
                                app which gives several options, giving a user the choice that is easiest and most
                                convenient.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                How might a user contact customer service? What was the best way to appease a customer?
                                I
                                observed that the G-Cash app had an intuitive feature with a process that made a
                                customer
                                feel
                                heard and hopeful.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I found that competitor research and analysis was the most challenging part of the process.
                            With
                            a
                            blank slate to fill, there was a need to be thorough in understanding the crucial elements
                            from
                            different apps (like puzzle pieces),
                            what to take from them that would be useful and effective, assembling them together to form
                            a
                            picture that aligned to the company's objectives and vision then applying and organizing
                            them
                            into
                            User Flows to form the
                            Information Architecture of the product -- the goal was not to cause information overload or
                            make
                            the navigation complex for the users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, the project was successful. By understanding the company's core values which puts
                            the
                            customers' satisfaction first, Balibago now offers a solution to the customers' needs with
                            an
